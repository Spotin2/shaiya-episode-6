# Documentation

This library is for the **game** service. Macros are used to represent the differences in the episode 6 packets, etc.

## Macros

To use this library with episode 5 clients, comment the episode 6 macros. This is the default.

```cpp
// sdev/include/shaiya/common.h
//#define SHAIYA_EP6
//#define SHAIYA_EP6_4_PT
```

For episode 6.4 clients, expose the `SHAIYA_EP6_4_PT` macro.

```cpp
// sdev/include/shaiya/common.h
//#define SHAIYA_EP6
#define SHAIYA_EP6_4_PT
```

Do not expose the `SHAIYA_EP6_BLACKSMITH` macro if you use Cheat Engine scripts for the blacksmith.

```cpp
// sdev/include/shaiya/common.h
//#define SHAIYA_EP6_BLACKSMITH
```

## Item Mall

The procedures in the [sql](https://github.com/kurtekat/shaiya-episode-6/tree/main/server/sdev/sql) directory need to be installed. If you skip this step, the item mall will not work. If you receive an error, change `ALTER` to `CREATE` and try again. This solution does not require a connection to SQL Server.

# Features

## NpcQuest

The episode 6 format has 6 quest results, each containing up to 3 items. The library reads the item count from memory. The original code passes 1 to **CUser::QuestAddItem**, which is why increasing the item count has no effect.

## Item Duration

The library expects the same day(s) to seconds conversion as the client.

| Days  | Duration    |
|-------|-------------|
| 1     | 86400       |
| 7     | 604800      |
| 15    | 1296000     |
| 30    | 2592000     |

Items will not be removed from guild warehouses. Items **will not** be deleted without sending a notification to the client. Check the **PS_GameData** database for modified stored procedures and custom triggers before opening an issue.

## Revenge Mark

The kill count will determine which effect will be rendered. Notice effects are not supported.

| KillCount         | Effect                     |
|-------------------|----------------------------|
| 0                 | N/A                        |
| 1                 | RevengeMark_Loop_01.EFT    |
| 2                 | RevengeMark_Loop_02.EFT    |
| 3                 | RevengeMark_Loop_03.EFT    |
| 4                 | RevengeMark_Loop_04.EFT    |
| 5                 | RevengeMark_Loop_05.EFT    |
| 6                 | RevengeMark_Loop_06.EFT    |
| 7                 | RevengeMark_Loop_07.EFT    |
| 8 (or greater)    | RevengeMark_Loop_08.EFT    |

The 6.4 PT client in this repository supports message 508, but does not support message 509.

```
508    "Your revenge to <t> has succeeded!"
509    "<t> killed  you <v> time(s)."
```

## Frenzied Skills

Skill ability 70 will be used for evaluation. The following skills are supported.

| SkillID    | SkillName           |
|------------|---------------------|
| 398        | Frenzied Force      |
| 399        | Frenzied Focus      |
| 400        | Frenzied Finesse    |
| 401        | Frenzied Fortune    |

## Mailbox

This feature will not be implemented.

## Chaotic Squares

### Free Combination

This feature will not be implemented.

### Money

The client uses the following math to determine the maximum gold input.

```
goldPerPercentage * 4 + goldPerPercentage
```

Set the minimum and maximum constants in **Synthesis.h** to change the result. The minimum will be used as a divisor (see packet_gem.cpp line 561), so don't set it to zero. The maximum money is the same as the official server.

```cpp
constexpr auto synthesis_min_money = 100000000U;
constexpr auto synthesis_max_money = 500000000U;
```

### Crafting Hammers

The item effect is expected to be 102. Use the **ReqVg** column in the **Items** table to store the success rate. The library will multiply the value by 100.

| ItemID    | ReqVg    |
|-----------|----------|
| 102074    | 5        |
| 102075    | 10       |

## Synergy

The library expects **SetItem.SData** to be in the **PSM_Client/Bin/Data** directory. I chose binary format because it's less error-prone than fetching the values from a database.

### Client Format

The client expects the file to be encrypted.

![Capture2](https://github.com/kurtekat/shaiya-episode-6/assets/142125482/01b93010-05a5-4323-b8d5-e890551ed4b7)

#### Bonus Description

`" Sinergia [5]\n- LUC +20\n- DEX +50\n- STR +70"`


### Server Format

The library expects the file to be decrypted. The bonus text is expected to be 12 comma-separated values.

![Capture](https://github.com/kurtekat/shaiya-episode-6/assets/142125482/a0a0c116-c5a0-4443-953e-35077e29f065)

The values are signed 32-bit integers, expected to be in the following order.

```cpp
int strength;
int dexterity;
int intelligence;
int wisdom;
int reaction;
int luck;
int health;
int mana;
int stamina;
int attackPower;
int rangedAttackPower;
int magicPower;
```
